## Project Description

This is a small project of mine: a collection of games I have digitized, provided as a pure browser application.

Available games are:

- Impostor (DE)



Everything is bundled into single HTML files: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Normally, it’s not considered a best practice to bundle everything into one file, but I made this decision intentionally to make the usage as simple as possible.

Each game comes with a description and instructions.

## Installation

The game-collection can be easily downloaded and run in the browser. No installation, no hassle. The only dependency is Bootstrap's CSS/JavaScript. An internet connection is required for this.

The games can also be played easily online. 

### Prerequisites:
- Up to date browser


### Steps:
1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/philbruck/game-collection.git

2. Use the HTML files you need

## Usage

Simply open the HTML files or access it online.
